C This is the 12 November 2003 version of
C DLSODA: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations, with
C         Automatic method switching for stiff and nonstiff problems.
C
C This version is in double precision.
C
C DLSODA solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
C systems of first order ODEs,
C     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form,
C     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ)) (i = 1,...,NEQ).
C
C This a variant version of the DLSODE package.
C It switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff methods.
C This means that the user does not have to determine whether the
C problem is stiff or not, and the solver will automatically choose the
C appropriate method.  It always starts with the nonstiff method.
